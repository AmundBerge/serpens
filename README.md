### Overview

Serpens is a soon-to-be chess engine and chess interface written in C++. It uses express.js to handle the backend. The project is far from finished, and the current version does not even have all the chess rules implemented. 

## Todo
 - Improve frontend-backend communication
 - Add position evalution
 - Add move generation
 - Playtest different versions of the engine

## Future goals and amibitons

My final goal for this project is to create a chess engine that can beat me in chess.
