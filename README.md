### Overview

Serpens is a soon-to-be chess engine and chess interface written in C++. It uses express.js to handle the backend. The project is far from finished, and the current version does not even have all the chess rules implemented. 

## Todo
 - Implement the choosing of which piece to promote to in the backend
 - Implement castling
 - Implement en passant
 - Implement checks and checkmate
 - Implement threefold repetition and 50-move rule
 - Update the frontend to implement the above
 - Freshen up the frontend a little, implement drag and drop pieces

## Future goals and amibitons

My final goal for this project is to create a chess engine that plays better chess than I do.
